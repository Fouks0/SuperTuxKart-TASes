# Fouks' SuperTuxKart TASes

In this repository, you will find my TASes (.replay and .stktas files). You can watch the ghosts in a normal STK but to see them the "Only show replays matching the current version" option must be unchecked. Unfortunately, SuperTuxKart is not deterministic accross different computers so you will likely be unable to replay the .stktas. However, you can still use them as starting points to make your own TASes.
